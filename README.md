# Magic Lambda Auth

Authentication and authorization helpers for Magic. This project allows you to create and consume
JWT tokens, to secure your magic installation. The project contains 3 slots.

* __[auth.ticket.create]__ - Creates a new JWT token, that you can return to your client, any ways you see fit
* __[auth.ticket.refresh]__ - Refreshes a JWT token. Useful for refreshing a token before it expires, which would require the user to login again
* __[auth.ticket.verify]__ - Verifies a JWT token, and that the user is logged in, in addition to (optionally) that he belongs to one roles supplied as a comma separated list of roles
* __[auth.ticket.in-role]__ - The same as **[auth.ticket.verify]**, but returns true or false, depending upon whether or not user is in any of the roles provided or not.

Notice, you will have to modify your `auth:secret` configuration setting, to provide a unique salt for your installation.
If you don't do this, some adversary can easily reproduce your tokens, and impersonate your users. Example of
an _"appsettings.json"_ secret you could apply can be found below (don't use the exact same salt, the idea is to provide
a _random_ salt, unique for _your_ installation)

However, during installation, Magic will automatically create a random secret for you.

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "secret":"some-rubbish-random23545456-characters-goes-hereqwertygfhdfSDFGFDdfgh45fDFGH"
  }
}
```

The idea is that your `SymmetricSecretKey` is based upon the above configuration setting, implying you should keep it
safe the same way you'd keep the pin code to your ATM card safe.

Below is an example of create a new JWT ticket.

```
auth.ticket.create
   username:foo
   roles
      .:howdy
      .:world
```
